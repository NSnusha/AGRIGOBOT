            "Agricultural Marketing in India\n",
            "\n",
            "Agricultural Marketing in Tamilnadu Agricultural Marketing in India India is an agricultural country and one third population depends on the agricultural sector directly or indirectly. Agriculture remains as the main stray of the Indian economy since times immemorial. Indian agriculture contribution to the national gross domestic product (GDP) is about 25 per cent. With food being the crowning need of mankind, much emphasis has been on commercialising agricultural production. For this reason, adequate production and even distribution of food has of late become a high priority global concern. Agricultural marketing is mainly the buying and selling of agricultural products. In earlier days when the village economy was more or less self-sufficient the marketing of agricultural products presented no difficulty as the farmer sold his produce to the consumer on a cash or barter basis. Today's agricultural marketing has to undergo a series of exchanges or transfers from one person to another before it reaches the consumer. There are three marketing functions involved in this, i.e., assembling, preparation for consumption and distribution. Selling on any agricultural produce depends on some couple of factors like the demand of the product at that time, availability of storage etc. The products may be sold directly in the market or it may be stored locally for the time being. Moreover, it may be sold as it is gathered from the field or it may be cleaned, graded and processed by the farmer or the merchant of the village. Sometime processing is done because consumers want it, or sometimes to conserve the quality of that product. The task of distribution system is to match the supply with the existing demand by whole selling and retailing in various points of different markets like primary, secondary or terminal markets.\n",
            "\n",
            "Most of the agricultural products in India are sold by farmers in the private sector to moneylenders (to whom the farmer may be indebted) or to village traders. Products are sold in various ways. For example, it might be sold at a weekly village market in the farmer's village or in a neighboring village. If these outlets are not available, then produce might be sold at irregularly held markets in a nearby village or town, or in the mandi. In India, there are several central government organisations, who are involved in agricultural marketing like, Commission of Agricultural Costs and Prices, Food Corporation of India, Cotton Corporation of India, Jute Corporation of India, etc. There are also specialised marketing bodies for rubber, tea, coffee, tobacco, spices and vegetables.\n",
            "\n",
            "Under the Agricultural Produce (grading and marketing) Act of 1937, more than forty primary commodities are compulsorily graded for export and voluntarily graded for internal consumption. Although the regulation of commodity markets is a function of state government, the directorate of marketing and inspection provides marketing and inspection services and financial aid down to the village level to help set up commodity grading centers in selected markets. As we have a tradition of agricultural production, marketing and allied commercial activities, now it is the time for us to brainstorm and come out with new ideas of value added services. These value added services will give the existing agricultural engine a new dimension. The next logical step could be food-processing which not only could be another revenue generating area but also can provide lots of full-time employment to our youths. With the changing agricultural scenario and global competition, there is a need of exploiting the available resources at maximum level. There was a survey undertaken by the directorate of marketing and inspection in the ministry of agriculture in 1970-71 and 1971-72, of five hundred regulated markets was, with a view to assessing the adequacy and efficiency of the existing regulated markets and highlighting their drawbacks and deficiencies and suggesting measures to develop them. One of the most important drawbacks has been the inadequate financial resources of some of the market committees. During the fourth plan, a central sector scheme was drawn up by the ministry of agriculture to provide a grant at 20 per cent of the cost of development of market, subject to a maximum of Rs. 2 lakhs. The balance will have to be provided by the commercial banks. Another important development in the field of regulated markets is the keen interest taken by the International Development Agency (IDA) in the development of the infrastructure in regulated markets. The IDA is financing the development of infrastructure in 50 markets of Bihar. There are also some good news on the front of irrigation, rural infrastructure, restoring water bodies and water harvesting. Another action initiated to improve the governance of the Small Farmers Agri-business Consortium (SFAC) including the appointment of a banker as the chief executive; necessary additional capital to be provided to SFAC.

            "The Vision of the Department of Agricultural Marketing & Agri Business is to ensure fair price to the farming community who are left behind in the competitive marketing scenario and the mission of achieving this is by enforcing the existing act and rules most effectively and also by devising, implementing new technologies aimed at reducing pre and post harvest losses through appropriate methods and encourage value addition. Green Revolution initiatives achieved self-sufficiency by increasing food grains production. Simultaneously, several initiatives have been taken to promote agricultural marketing in the state. Agricultural Marketing infrastructure plays a pivotal role in fostering and sustaining the tempo of rural economic development. Marketing is as critical to better performance in agriculture as farming itself. Agri Business is a process, which starts with a decision to produce a saleable farm commodity and it involves all the aspects relating to pre and post-harvest operations including grading, value addition, packaging, processing and transportation. These operations add value to farm produce. The Department of Agricultural Marketing, which is functioning since 1977, with the main objective of Regulation of Agricultural Marketing, was renamed in the year 2001 as Department of Agricultural Marketing and Agri.

            "The bull market for grain futures is on a six-month rally thanks to a smaller U.S. crop and strong demand. Based on current information, and barring any black swans, the outlook for old-crop corn and soybeans looks to remain friendly into summer. But even the best bull runs in previous years have had price corrections lower along the way. Is a price correction coming in February? Here are a few important things to be aware of that could affect trade.\n",
            "\n",
            "Seasonals\n",
            "\n",
            "Looking at seasonal charts for both corn and soybean futures, there is a strong tendency for a price correction lower starting in a time frame of mid- February to early March. Part of the reason for seasonal tendency is because the South American crop becomes harvested and available to the world during that same window. Also, South American crop export demand picks up, with demand for U.S. crop slowing down.\n",
            "\n",
            "Important Dates to Be Aware of\n",
            "\n",
            "The next USDA report for grains is Tuesday, February 9. This is a regular monthly supply and demand report. Most likely it will have a supportive tone as ending stocks continue to shrink. How much of that friendly tone may already be priced into the market is what needs to be monitored. The days following the report are also important.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Chinese New Year begins on Friday, February 12. For nearly a week much of the country is off from work, spending time celebrating with friends and family. It will be interesting to see if China is an active grain buyer during this week or not. February 12 is also important as it is the last trading day before a three-day U.S. holiday weekend. On Monday, February 15 , the markets will be closed for President’s Day. There may be position squaring done on Friday, February 12, so traders do not hold positions over a three-day holiday weekend.\n",
            "\n",
            "The last important event taking place in February is the USDA Outlook Forum, happening on Thursday, February 18 and Friday, February 19. The event will be virtual this year, but traditionally at this event the USDA puts forth their first guesstimates for how many acres of grain will be planted in the U.S. this spring. Expect big numbers. They also use trendline yields in their equations, so on paper, there will be the appearance of a potential for a large U.S. crop planted this spring. Oftentimes, traders grab hold of this news and trade it as gospel until proven otherwise.\n",
            "\n",
            "So while the long-term outlook for grain remains friendly for now, there may be a few bumps in the road ahead. Trade will continuously monitor demand and South American weather in the short term. Be thinking of your old- and new-crop cash sales.

agricultural sector directly or indirectly.', 'Agriculture remains as the main stray of the Indian economy since times immemorial.', 'Indian agriculture contribution to the national gross domestic product (GDP) is about 25 per cent.', 'With food being the crowning need of mankind, much emphasis has been on commercialising agricultural production.', 'For this reason, adequate production and even distribution of food has of late become a high priority global concern.', 'Agricultural marketing is mainly the buying and selling of agricultural products.', 'In earlier days when the village economy was more or less self-sufficient the marketing of agricultural products presented no difficulty as the farmer sold his produce to the consumer on a cash or barter basis.', \"Today's agricultural marketing has to undergo a series of exchanges or transfers from one person to another before it reaches the consumer.\", 'There are three marketing functions involved in this, i.e., assembling, preparation for consumption and distribution.', 'Selling on any agricultural produce depends on some couple of factors like the demand of the product at that time, availability of storage etc.', 'The products may be sold directly in the market or it may be stored locally for the time being.', 'Moreover, it may be sold as it is gathered from the field or it may be cleaned, graded and processed by the farmer or the merchant of the village.', 'Sometime processing is done because consumers want it, or sometimes to conserve the quality of that product.', 'The task of distribution system is to match the supply with the existing demand by whole selling and retailing in various points of different markets like primary, secondary or terminal markets.', 'Most of the agricultural products in India are sold by farmers in the private sector to moneylenders (to whom the farmer may be indebted) or to village traders.', 'Products are sold in various ways.', \"For example, it might be sold at a

with new ideas of value added services.', 'These value added services will give the existing agricultural engine a new dimension.', 'The next logical step could be food-processing which not only could

agriculture to provide a grant at 20 per cent of the cost of development of market, subject to a maximum of Rs.', '2 lakhs.', 'The balance will have to be provided by the commercial banks.', 'Another

agricultural sector directly or indirectly.', 'Agriculture remains as the main stray of the Indian economy since times immemorial.', 'Indian agriculture contribution to the national gross domestic product (GDP) is about 25 per cent.', 'With food being the crowning need of mankind, much emphasis has been on commercialising agricultural production.', 'For this reason, adequate production and even distribution of food has of late become a high priority global concern.', 'Agricultural marketing is mainly the buying and selling of agricultural products.', 'In earlier days when the village economy was more or less self-sufficient the marketing of agricultural products presented no difficulty as the farmer sold his produce to the consumer on a cash or barter basis.', \"Today's agricultural marketing has to undergo a series of exchanges or transfers from one person to another before it reaches the consumer.\", 'There are three marketing functions involved in this, i.e., assembling, preparation for consumption and distribution.', 'Selling on any agricultural produce depends on some couple of factors like the demand of the product at that time, availability of storage etc.', 'The products may be sold directly in the market or it may be stored locally for the time being.', 'Moreover, it may be sold as it is gathered from the field or it may be cleaned, graded and processed by the farmer or the merchant of the village.', 'Sometime processing is done because consumers want it, or sometimes to conserve the quality of that product.', 'The task of distribution system is to match the supply with the existing demand by whole selling and retailing in various points of different markets like primary, secondary or terminal markets.', 'Most of the agricultural products in India are sold by farmers in the private sector to moneylenders (to whom the farmer may be indebted) or to village traders.', 'Products are sold in various ways.', \"For example, it might be sold at a weekly village market in the farmer's village or in a neighboring village.\", 'If these outlets are not available, then produce might be sold at irregularly held markets in a nearby village or town, or in the mandi.', 'In India, there are several central government organisations, who are involved in agricultural marketing like, Commission of Agricultural Costs and Prices, Food Corporation of India, Cotton Corporation of India, Jute Corporation of India, etc.', 'There are also specialised marketing bodies for rubber, tea, coffee, tobacco, spices and vegetables.', 'Under the Agricultural Produce (grading and marketing) Act of 1937, more than forty primary commodities are compulsorily graded for export and voluntarily graded for internal consumption.', 'Although the regulation of commodity markets is a function of state government, the directorate of marketing and inspection provides marketing and inspection services and financial aid down to the village level to help set up commodity grading centers in selected markets.', 'As we have a tradition of agricultural production, marketing and allied commercial activities, now it is the time for us to brainstorm and come out with new ideas of value added services.', 'These value added services will give the existing agricultural engine a new dimension.', 'The next logical step could be food-processing which not only could be another revenue generating area but also can provide lots of full-time employment to our youths.', 'With the changing agricultural scenario and global competition, there is a need of exploiting the available resources at maximum level.', 'There was a survey undertaken by the directorate of marketing and inspection in the ministry of agriculture in 1970-71 and 1971-72, of five hundred regulated markets was, with a view to assessing the adequacy and efficiency of the existing regulated markets and highlighting their drawbacks and deficiencies and suggesting measures to develop them.', 'One of the most important drawbacks has been the inadequate financial resources of some of the market committees.', 'During the fourth plan, a central sector scheme was drawn up by the ministry of agriculture to provide a grant at 20 per cent of the cost of development of market, subject to a maximum of Rs.', '2 lakhs.', 'The balance will have to be provided by the commercial banks.', 'Another important development in the field of regulated markets is the keen interest taken by the International Development Agency (IDA) in the development of the infrastructure in regulated markets.', 'The IDA is financing the development of infrastructure in 50 markets of Bihar.', 'There are also some good news on the front of irrigation, rural infrastructure, restoring water bodies and water harvesting.', 'Another action initiated to improve the governance of the Small Farmers Agri-business Consortium (SFAC) including the appointment of a banker as the chief executive; necessary

seasonal charts for both corn and soybean futures, there is a strong tendency for a price correction lower starting in a time frame of mid- February to early March.', 'Part of the reason for seasonal tendency is because the South American crop becomes harvested and available to the world during that same window.', 'Also, South American crop export demand picks up, with demand for U.S. crop slowing down.', 'Important Dates to Be Aware of\\n\\nThe next USDA report for grains is Tuesday, February 9.', 'This is a regular monthly supply and demand report.', 'Most likely it will have a supportive tone as ending stocks continue to shrink.', 'How much of that friendly tone may already be priced into the market is what needs to be monitored.', 'The days following the report are also important.', 'The Chinese New Year begins on Friday, February 12.', 'For nearly a week much of the country is off from work, spending time celebrating with friends and family.', 'It will be interesting to see if China is an active grain buyer during this week or not.', 'February 12 is also important as it is the last trading day before a three-day U.S. holiday weekend.', 'On Monday, February 15 , the markets will be closed for President’s Day.', 'There may be position squaring done on Friday, February 12, so traders do not hold positions over a three-day holiday weekend.', 'The last important event taking place in February is the USDA Outlook Forum, happening on Thursday, February 18 and Friday, February 19.', 'The event will be virtual this year, but traditionally at this event the USDA puts forth their first guesstimates for how many acres of grain will be planted in the U.S. this spring.', 'Expect big numbers.', 'They also use trendline yields in their equations, so on paper, there will be the appearance of a potential for a large U.S. crop planted this spring.', 'Oftentimes, traders grab hold of this news and trade it as gospel until proven otherwise.', 'So while the long-term outlook for grain remains friendly for now, there may be a few bumps in the road ahead.', 'Trade will continuously monitor demand and South American weather in the short term.', 'Be thinking of your old- and new-crop cash sales.', 'Be ready to both manage the risk, and reward, in the coming months.', 'If you have questions, you can reach Naomi at naomi@totalfarmmarketing.com or visit
